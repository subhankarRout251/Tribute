    Why I reasonated with Virgil
    </h3>
    <p>
    I loved Virgil simply because of the boundaries he pushed as a black man. He showed the world that we don't have to be any of the <em style="font-weight: bold;">stereotypes</em> such as an athlete, rapper, or drug dealer.  Although, I have no issues with being an athlete or a rapper; it's just beautiful to see that we have more options to choose from as oppose to the stereotypes mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another reason I reasonated with Abloh is because he never allowed himself to be defined as just a <em style="font-weight: bold;">designer</em>, but as a creative that explored the world of skating, music, fashion, engineering, and architecture. This was so refreshing to see as I have seen <em style="font-weight: bold;">titles</em> consume so many individuals in their careers.

    It was in 2017 when Nike patterned up with Virgil to design 10 sneakers known as 'THE TEN' collection. My favourite pair was the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/4/off-white-air-jordan-1-better-look" target="_blank">Air Jordan 1</a> this is because it has this timeless feel to the design.
